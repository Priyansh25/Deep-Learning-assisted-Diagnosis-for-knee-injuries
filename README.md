Implementation of a convolutional neural network that classifies ACL tears from MRI exams
## Dataset
The data comes from Stanford ML Group research lab. It consits of 1,370 knee MRI exams performed at Stanford University Medical Center to 
study the presence of Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) tears.
## Results
I trained an ACL tear classifier on a sagittal plane and got the following AUC scores:

on train: 0.8669
on validation: 0.8850
